Steps to go public (excluding domain & RAG)
1. Wire up authentication (blocking — nothing works without it)
Sign-in/sign-up pages have forms but zero event handlers — no signIn() calls, no form submissions
Add SessionProvider wrapper in layout.tsx so client components can read session
Wire OAuth buttons and credentials form to NextAuth
Add sign-out functionality
2. Build the Claims API + dynamic rendering
GET /api/claims — list claims (with filters, pagination)
GET /api/claims/[id] — single claim detail
POST /api/claims — admin-only claim creation
Replace the hardcoded claim cards in page.tsx with real data fetching
For launch, you'd seed ~20-30 gym/fitness claims manually (e.g. "Creatine increases muscle mass", "Cold plunges improve recovery", "BCAAs are unnecessary if protein is adequate")
3. Build voting flow (the core interaction)
POST /api/claims/[id]/vote — place YES/NO vote, deduct 1 coin
Vote state management: show buttons → submit → reveal results after 6h timer or coin unlock
Guest voting (4 free credits, no account needed)
Hidden percentages until after voting (already a design decision)
4. Extract shared layout components
Header/nav is copy-pasted across every page — make a single <Header /> component
Mobile-responsive nav (burger menu)
Footer component
Coin balance display in header (already designed, needs session wiring)
5. Add essential pages
/about — linked from homepage, doesn't exist
/privacy and /terms — required for OAuth providers (Google/GitHub mandate a privacy policy)
/not-found (404) and error.tsx (500) — Next.js conventions
loading.tsx skeletons for claims list and dashboard
6. Seed data + admin tooling
Prisma seed script with 20-30 fitness/gym claims, each with a verdict status
Minimal admin page to add/edit/resolve claims (can be bare-bones, only you use it)
Or: a CLI seed script + Prisma Studio for admin work at launch
7. Daily login + coin economy frontend
Button/banner to claim daily coins (endpoint exists, nothing calls it)
Coin history page or panel (endpoint exists, no UI)
Deep analysis unlock button on claim pages (endpoint exists, no UI)
8. Environment + database setup for production
Provision PostgreSQL with pgvector on Railway (or Supabase/Neon)
Provision Redis on Railway (or Upstash)
Set all env vars: DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, AUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, OAuth keys
Run npx prisma migrate deploy in production
OpenAI key (needed for moderation even without RAG)
9. Security hardening
Rate limiting on API routes (especially auth, voting, daily-login)
Zod validation on all API inputs (Zod is installed, not used)
CSRF is handled by Auth.js already
Sanitize any user-generated content
10. SEO + fitness niche positioning
Per-page metadata (title/description for claims, trend pages)
robots.txt and sitemap.xml (Next.js has built-in support)
Open Graph tags for social sharing ("Is creatine worth it? 73% say yes")
Rename/rebrand from "HealthProof" to something gym/fitness-focused if desired
11. Deploy
Railway already has a Procfile configured (web + worker)
npm run build must succeed cleanly
Set NEXTAUTH_URL to your production URL
Configure OAuth redirect URIs in Google/GitHub console
12. Nice-to-haves before launch (optional but impactful)
Toast notifications (dependency installed, no component)
Dark mode toggle (CSS vars defined, no mechanism)
Leaderboard page (mentioned on landing page)
Newsletter signup (endpoint needed + email provider integration like Resend)
Basic analytics (Plausible, PostHog, or Vercel Analytics)
Suggested build order for fastest path to public
Priority	Task	Why
P0	Auth wiring (#1)	Everything depends on it
P0	Claims API + seed data (#2, #6)	Core content
P0	Voting flow (#3)	Core interaction — the reason users visit
P1	Shared layout + missing pages (#4, #5)	Polish + legal (privacy/terms)
P1	Production infra (#8)	Can't deploy without it
P1	Coin economy frontend (#7)	Retention mechanic
P2	Security + SEO (#9, #10)	Important but can iterate
P2	Deploy (#11)	Once the above works locally
