1) Core information architecture (what pages exist)
A. Trend pages (SEO acquisition)

Examples: “Creatine for muscle”, “Berberine for weight loss”, “Apple cider vinegar”, “Collagen for skin”.

Each trend page should include:

Bottom-line verdict card (Supported / Mixed / Insufficient / Contradicted + confidence + effect size direction)

Evidence snapshot (top 3–5 sources, last updated date)

Forecasting module (“What do you think the evidence will conclude?”)

Verdict history (how the verdict changed over time)

Newsletter CTA (“Get weekly resolved claims + trend alerts”)

Monetization integrations (detailed below): ads, affiliate (policy-gated), sponsorship slot.

B. Claim/market pages (retention)

One specific, testable claim per page (YES/NO market, or graded rubric mapped to YES/NO).

Market odds/pools + place a stake (if you implement Steps 3–5)

Full resolution write-up (free summary + premium deep dive)

Discussion and citations

Monetization integrations: premium deep dives, subscription-only tools, tournaments/events.

C. Weekly digest pages (share + newsletter landing)

A “Resolved this week” page that mirrors the email digest:

10–20 recently resolved markets

Biggest upsets

Top predictors

Monetization: newsletter sponsorships + upsell subscription.

2) Revenue streams and how to integrate each one
Stream 1: Display ads (top-of-funnel monetization)

Where it fits

Primarily on trend pages and digest pages (high traffic, low friction).

Keep market pages relatively clean to protect trust and conversion.

Implementation pattern

Ads appear:

below the first verdict card (not above it)

between sections (evidence snapshot ↔ FAQs)

never inside citations or within the verdict card

Guardrails

Add an “Ad policy” page and label ads clearly.

Expect restrictions on some healthcare/medicine-related advertising and terms; ad platforms can limit certain health categories and require compliance with their policies.

Why this works in the hybrid

SEO traffic is volatile; ads monetize even one-time visitors.

Forecasting layer remains “premium-quality,” not cluttered.

Stream 2: Affiliate revenue (high-ROI, but trust-sensitive)

Where it fits

Only on trend pages (not in markets), and only when your rubric says Supported (or “Supported with high confidence”).

How to integrate (policy-based)

Add a module: “If you choose to buy: vetted options”

Rules:

Only link to products that match the exact ingredient/dose used in supporting studies.

No “miracle” language; keep it factual (“contains 5g creatine monohydrate per serving”).

Show the evidence verdict above the affiliate module.

Disclosures

Display “This page may contain affiliate links…” near the module and near the first outbound link.

Disclosures must be “clear and conspicuous” for material connections (commissions, free products, etc.).

Why it works

Converts best on high-intent queries (“does X work?” → “which X should I buy?”).

Keeps your brand consistent: you only monetize when evidence supports it.

Stream 3: Newsletter sponsorships (reliable early revenue)

Where it fits

Weekly email: “Resolved this week” + “Trending now”

Sponsors buy a slot in the email (and optionally a slot on the digest page).

Implementation pattern

One sponsor placement per email:

top or mid-email

clearly labeled “Sponsor”

optionally include UTM tracking

Rate model:

CPM or flat fee based on list size and engagement; common CPM ranges vary by niche and list quality.

Why it works in the hybrid

Trend pages drive signups.

Forecasting/resolution cadence creates consistently fresh email content.

Stream 4: Subscription (primary long-term monetization lever)

Where it fits

Monetize the power-user layer:

advanced dashboards

deep research tooling

alerts

exports

faster access to full write-ups

Packaging (recommended)

Free:

verdict card + short rationale + top sources

basic forecasts (or low-stakes staking)

Pro:

full deep dives (methods/extraction notes)

“what would change the verdict”

personal track record / calibration

topic alerts (“new RCT/meta-analysis published”)

advanced filters and saved collections

Why it works

Trends bring broad traffic; subscriptions monetize the segment that repeatedly returns and cares about the details.

Stream 5: “Coins” as retention spend (do not rely on coin sales)

With “no cash-out,” coins are best used to:

stake on markets (if implemented)

unlock deep dives (you already built this)

propose/boost claims (proposal deposit + bounties)

join tournaments/events (entry fees → prize pool + burn)

Important constraint

If you plan to sell coins for real money and coins can be staked on outcomes, this can look gambling-adjacent in many jurisdictions even without cash-out. A safer path is:

sell subscriptions/features/cosmetics, not “wager currency,” until you have legal review.

Stream 6: B2B/API/licensing (high upside, later)

Where it fits

Provide:

“Evidence verdict + confidence + last updated”

“Trend velocity” (what claims are rising)

“Resolved markets feed”

Sell to:

creators/newsletters

wellness apps

publishers

Integration

“Embed this trend card” widget (free tier with branding; paid tier without branding + API access)

This also becomes a distribution channel back into your site.

3) How the user journey ties revenue together
Journey 1: SEO visitor → monetization immediately

User Googles “does berberine help weight loss”

Lands on trend page

Sees verdict card + short evidence snapshot

Sees:

display ads (revenue now)

affiliate module (only if Supported)

newsletter signup (future revenue)

Optional: makes a forecast on the linked market (retention hook)

Journey 2: Forecasting user → subscription conversion

User forecasts on several markets

Returns for resolution drops

Wants to understand why they were wrong/right

Upgrades for deep dives + dashboards + alerts

Journey 3: Newsletter → sponsor + retention

Weekly “Resolved this week” email goes out (sponsor)

User clicks into digest page (ads + upsell)

User places forecasts (retention)

4) MVP scope for the hybrid monetization model
You can launch the hybrid MVP without staking payouts if:

Trend pages + verdict cards + citations are strong

Newsletter is live

Forecasting is “prediction tracking” (not coin staking)

To fully validate “coins as retention,” you need:

staking/escrow + settlement (so users experience meaningful wins/losses)

5) Compliance/trust requirements that directly affect monetization

Affiliate/sponsor disclosure must be prominent and understandable (FTC “clear and conspicuous”; EU misleading-commercial-practices guidance).

Ad platform policies may restrict certain healthcare/medicine advertising terms and categories; plan for policy review and conservative language.
